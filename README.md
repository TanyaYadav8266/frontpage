# DevOps-Driven Blog Website

## Project Overview

This is a **DevOps-driven blog website** designed to integrate multiple DevOps practices including CI/CD, version control, monitoring, and automated testing. The project uses technologies such as **Docker**, **Jenkins**, **MySQL**, **PHP**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **SonarQube** to ensure a scalable, efficient, and secure platform. 

The blog website allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts with a backend powered by **PHP** and **MySQL**. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines are set up to automate the building, testing, and deployment processes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **DevOps Tools:**
  - Docker for containerization
  - Jenkins for CI/CD
  - SonarQube for static code analysis
  - Prometheus for monitoring
  - Grafana for visualization
  - GitHub for version control

## Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker & Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. **Jenkins**: Make sure Jenkins is set up for CI/CD pipelines.
3. **SonarQube**: Static code analysis to ensure code quality.
4. **GitHub Repository**: This project uses GitHub for version control.

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. Docker Setup:

Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:
bash
Copy
docker-compose up -d --build
Jenkins Setup:

Set up a Jenkins pipeline using the Jenkinsfile in the repository.
Connect Jenkins with your GitHub repository to trigger builds upon new commits.
SonarQube Setup:

Install SonarQube in your system or use Docker to run SonarQube.
Add the SonarQube configuration in your Jenkins pipeline for static code analysis.
Prometheus and Grafana Setup:

Install Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for visualizing the metrics.
Set up Prometheus to scrape data from your running services (PHP, MySQL, etc.).
Access the website:

After the Docker containers are up, access the blog website at http://localhost:8082 (configured via Docker).
Project Architecture
The architecture of the blog website includes the following components:

Frontend: A responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to interact with the blog.
Backend (PHP + MySQL): The backend runs on PHP and communicates with MySQL for storing blog posts and user data.
DevOps Tools Integration:
Docker: Containerization of the website for easy deployment across different environments.
Jenkins: Automates the process of testing and deployment to production.
SonarQube: Analyzes the code quality before deployment.
Prometheus + Grafana: Monitors the services and provides real-time dashboards for system performance.
CI/CD Pipeline
The pipeline ensures continuous integration and delivery for the project. It includes the following stages:

Build: Docker images for PHP, MySQL, and other services are built.
Test: Static code analysis is done using SonarQube. Unit and integration tests are run.
Deploy: The application is deployed to the staging/production environment after successful tests.

Jenkinsfile Example:

pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        IMAGE_NAME = 'blog-website'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build(IMAGE_NAME)
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sonarScanner scannerHome: tool 'SonarQube', additionalArguments: '-Dsonar.projectKey=my_blog_project'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    deployToProduction()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Monitoring & Logging
Prometheus: Used for monitoring the health and performance of services like MySQL, PHP.
Grafana: Dashboards are created to visualize metrics and logs from Prometheus.
Logstash & Fluentd (optional): For collecting logs from different services and sending them to a centralized location.
Security Tools
SonarQube: Ensures that static code analysis is performed before deployment.
OWASP ZAP: Can be used to detect vulnerabilities in the application.
Trivy: Used to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
